UR3e Helper Scripts Package
---------------------------

This is a ROS2 and MoveIt2 based package, created to assist MasterClass students of The Construct.

This package contains programs and scripts to assist with Checkpoints that use UR3e Real Robot.
These helper scripts aims to reduce block setting up time during real-robot sessions.

This package was created with the notion to assist students to setup a block at the initial block "pick-up" spot for pick-and-place tasks using UR3e Robot itself.
This eliminates the need for some person in the lab to physically set the block at the initial "pick" position every time.

The programs were made in a short time for quick use. Improvements will be released in the future versions.


Contents of Package:
--------------------

1. Source Files:
    1. display_current_pose.cpp - This program displays the current pose (position & orientation) of the UR3 Arm and Gripper only (and does nothing else).
	2. move_to_blocks.cpp - This program positions the UR3e Arm close towards the area of blocks.
    3. move_to_coords.cpp - This program positions the UR3e Arm at the target pose coordinates.
    4. reset_grasp_object.cpp - This program takes the object from the pick pose and places back near the group of blocks.

How to Use:
-----------

Usually, you will find a block positioned at the initial "pick-up" spot, where it is marked with a X-in-a-box symbol.
But in some cases, you might not find a block positioned at that place. The helper programs in this package will help you setup a block.
But beware, this is not a magical program that will automatically set a block for you from anywhere! It also requires some input from you.

You will need at least 4 terminals to run this program:
1. Use the first terminal, to launch the "move_group" [MoveIt framework] program for the real robot.
2. Use the second terminal, to launch the "moveit_rviz" [MoveIt RViz2 GUI] program for the real robot.
3. Use the third terminal to launch the helper scripts - "move_to_blocks" and "setup_grasp_object".
4. Use the fourth terminal to launch your pick-and-place program that you have designed.

Usage Steps:
------------
1. Launch "move_group" node for Real Robot
2. Launch "moveit_rviz" node for Real Robot
3. Launch "move_to_blocks" program for Real Robot
4. Use the MoveIt RViz GUI to position the gripper above the object to grasp. DO NOT close the gripper manually!
5. Launch "setup_grasp_object" program with relevant launch arguments.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------
You need to change the package name in the launch files to the name of the MoveIt2 Configuration Package that you have created for the Simulation and the Real Robot(s).
You also need to change the PLANNING_GROUP names from "ur3_arm" and "gripper" to the values that you have defined in your MoveIt2 Configuration Package.
You must change the names in the following two lines in all the C++ program codes present in the "ur3e_helper_scripts/src" directory.
1. static const std::string PLANNING_GROUP_UR3_ARM = "ur3_arm"; // replace "ur3_arm" as required
2. static const std::string PLANNING_GROUP_GRIPPER = "gripper"; // replace "gripper" as required

Geometry Conventions:
---------------------

The block is always setup in a "standing" pose. Therefore, gripping the block by the longest side of the block is not viable for block setup.

Block dimension convention: Given the fact that the block will NEVER be gripped by the longest side, we will use the other two sides for gripping.
The longest side is the Height. The smallest side is the Breadth. The wide side (third side) is the Length.
Example: 0.025 x 0.015 x 0.075 : Here, 0.075 is Height [not Length], 0.025 is Length and 0.015 is Breadth.

You will find two types of grasping / gripping in the program - "wide_grip" and "slim_grip".
1. wide_grip - Sets the gripper to grasp the block by the Length side - Sets the gripper gap to block Length measure - Gripper gap = Block Length.
2. slim_grip - Sets the gripper to grasp the block by the Breadth Side - Sets the gripper gap to block Breadth measure - Gripper gap = Block Breadth.
You can choose the type of gripping before you start the "setup_grasp_object" program in the launch command line.
NOTE: "wide_grip" and "slim_grip" will be omitted when Cube is chosen as grasp object instead of Block.


Some Advice on Usage:
---------------------
PLEASE TRY EVERYTHING IN THE SIMULATION BEFORE USING IT ON THE REAL ROBOT TO ENSURE THERE ARE NO ACCIDENTS !!!
Please make sure to set the UR3e Robot ALWAYS in a "Home" position BEFORE you exit the Real Robot Lab session.
Leaving the robot arm pointing outside is not encouraged and it is not a good practice.

Some Extra Words:
-----------------
This program does not use Inverse Kinematics for Path Planning. This is because, in the simulation, the objects keep falling off the gripper.
On an average, 2 out of 10 times, the gripper grips the object correctly and takes it to the target position, with Cartesian Path Planning.
When Inverse Kinematics is used, the object does not get gripped properly every time and simulation fails ~90% of the times.
Inverse Kinematics makes weird path plans that also sometimes collides into nearby solid objects like table, wall, etc.
Therefore, the Path Planning ONLY uses fixed Cartesian Movements with Waypoints to target poses.
